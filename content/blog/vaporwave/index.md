Helloo ! I am Sehan Pushparaja, a budding developer who aspires to build impactful fullstack applications. You can easilly distract me when you talk about JavaScript, Node, SAS, Machine Learning, AWS, Art and Food. I know, its a weird combination. But everything wonderful in life is weird at first. Isnt't it?
I plan to use this blog to share my ideas, learnings, art work and everything in life that interests this developer.
Head over to About Page to learn more about me or use the Tags Section to filter out the articles that interest you.
I will be adding more features to this site, more content progressively. 
You can contact me through linkedIn or email : sehanp@gmail.com

P.S: Thanks for vaporwavy for sharing their idea of this Gatsbyjs blog. It was helpful to get a fast start.
And now its my time to contribute to this wonderful society.
